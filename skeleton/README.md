# Dev Bones - Skeleton
https://sayskez.github.io/dev-bones/

## What?
Starter boilerplate skeleton with all the HTML metadata, CSS resets, and best practices you need to spin up a site fast. Because sometimes you donâ€™t need the latest framework or task runner. Going for a bigger build? Scale up your skeleton to a [zombie](https://github.com/SaysKez/dev-bones/tree/master/zombie).

### What's Inside:
- All the basics, none of the hassle: add your own flesh & bones without bothering with getting the metadata in place.
  - CSS resets & smart browser defaults;
  - HTML metadata and links all set up, awaiting customisation.
- File structure ready to go:
  - `css` for your styles
  - `js` for your scripts
  - `img` for your... well images
- Nothing you don't need. If you don't need a fancy framework and compiling, don't use it.

## How to Use
Download the skeleton files and hack away! Or grab some sematic HTML elements and common CSS styles from the [Flesh & Bones](https://github.com/SaysKez/dev-bones/tree/master/flesh-and-bones) collection.
